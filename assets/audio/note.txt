Since direct downloads are failing due to 403 Forbidden errors, we'll use a different approach:

1. We'll create an audio element in the HTML that uses a data URI for a very small audio file
2. For a production site, you should replace this with a proper audio file by:
   - Manually downloading a royalty-free music file
   - Placing it in this directory
   - Updating the audio src attribute in the HTML files
